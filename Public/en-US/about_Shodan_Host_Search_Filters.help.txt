FILTERS

    For Search-ShodanHost and Measure-ShodanHost in the query option one can 
    provide inside the search query filters using a "filter:value" format. For
    example, the following search query would find Apache webservers located in
    Germany: "apache country:DE".The following filters are currently supported:

     - after: Only show results that were collected after the given date 
       (dd/mm/yyyy).

     - before: Only show results that were collected before the given date
       (dd/mm/yyyy).

     - city: Show results that are located in the given city.

     - country: Show results that are located within the given country.

     - geo: There are 2 modes to the geo filter: radius and bounding box. To
       limit results based on a radius around a pair of latitude/ longitude,
       provide 3 parameters; ex: geo:50,50,100. If you want to find all results
       within a bounding box, supply the top left and bottom right coordinates
       for the region; ex: geo:10,10,50,50.
