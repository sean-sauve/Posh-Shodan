SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the search facets that can be used when performing a search for
    information of hosts using shodan.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Describes the search facets that can be used when performing a search for
    information of hosts using shodan. Best approach is to use facets in
    conjunction with filters with the Measure-ShodanHost command so as to not
    consume any credit and narrow the search to only the information desired.

FILTERS

    For Search-ShodanHost and Measure-ShodanHost Facet names can be in the format
    of "property:count", where "count" is the number of facets that will be 
    returned for a property (i.e. "country:100" to get the top 100 countries for
    a search query). The following facets are currently supported:

    - asn: Autonomous system number.
    
    - city: Name of the city where the device is located.
    
    - country: 2-letter country code where the device is located.
    
    - device: The type of device (webcam, router, etc.).
    
    - domain: The primary domain for the hostname of the device; i.e. the 
      hostname without any subdomains.
    
    - geocluster: Group devices based on their latitude/ longitude into 
      geographic regions/ clusters.
    
    - isp: The ISP that is providing the organization with the IP space for
      this device.
    
    - link: The network link type. Possible values are: "Ethernet or modem",
      "generic tunnel or VPN", "DSL", "IPIP or SIT", "SLIP", "IPSec or GRE",
      "VLAN", "jumbo Ethernet", "Google", "GIF", "PPTP", "loopback", "AX.25 
      radio modem".
    
    - ntp.ip: The IPs that were returned from running the NTP monlist command.
    
    - ntp.ip_count: The number of IPs that were returned by the NTP monlist
      command; values can range from 0 to 6.
    
    - ntp.more: Boolean value indicating whether or not there were more than 6
      IPs available from the server.
    
    - ntp.port: The port numbers that the IPs in the monlist command used to 
      interact with the NTP server.
    
    - org: The name of the organization that is assigned the IP space for this
      device.
    
    - os: The operating system that powers the device.
    
    - port: The port number that the service is operating on.
    
    - timestamp_day: Provide a breakdown of when the banners were last updated,
      broken down by days.
